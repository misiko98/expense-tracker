# Expense Tracker (Work in Progress)

This project is a personal take on the Expense Tracker application originally taught by Jonas Schmedtmann in his Udemy course. The original project was built using basic React CSS, but this version uses Tailwind CSS and Styled Components for the UI.

In this version of the project, I have added **basic client-side validation**, which was not present in the original project. I have also implemented the project by tweaking it a bit and trying different approaches to solve the problems.

## Features (Planned)

- Track expenses for different years
- Filter expenses by year
- Visualize expenses with a chart
- Basic client-side validation

## Installation (Coming Soon)

## Credits

This project is based on the Expense Tracker project from Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course. All credit for the original project idea and design goes to him.
